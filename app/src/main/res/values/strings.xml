    <string name="h887787l1">Restless in travel, this is the misfortune you get. (Trifling with unimportant matters, the traveler draws upon himself calamity.)</string>

    <string name="h878777l2">One is unequal to the conflict, and flees to home. If you have enough allies there will be no trouble.</string>
    <string name="h878777l3">Keeping the place previously earned, it is best to be firmly correct. There will be good fortune in the end. If working for the public good, do not expect recognition of your success.</string>

    <string name="h777778l2">A cry of warning. One arms at night against the unexpected without fear.</string>
    <string name="h777778l3">To display too much strength in the face — misfortune. The superior person parts, walks alone in the rain. He gets wet. He is unhappy. Without fault.</string>

    <string name="h888787l1">Progressing, but turned back. Perseverance (in the way) brings good fortune. If one meets with no confidence, one should remain calm (Absence: conforming). No error.</string>

    <string name="h888787l3">Crowds, sincerity, repenting extinguished.</string>
    <string name="h888787l4">Squirrel-like progress. Persistence is dangerous, even if correct. [Seems to suggest progress in a sneaky and underhanded way, or progress that is too rapid, it\'s vulnerable.]</string>
    <string name="h888787l5">Regret vanishes. Loss or gain, don\'t worry. To act brings good fortune: everything is favorable.</string>
    <string name="h888787l6">Making progress using horns is permissible only for the purpose of punishing one\'s own city. The position is perilous, but there will be good fortune. Yet, however firm and correct one is, there will be shame/regret.</string>

    <string name="h878887l5">The ignorance of the inexperienced (innocence) brings good fortune.</string>

    <string name="h878877l3">Dispersing the self. Without repenting.</string>
    <string name="h878877l4">Dispersing his group of companions — sublime good fortune. On dispersal there is gathering, this is inconceivable to the ordinary.</string>
    <string name="h878877l5">One is amidst the dispersion issuing great announcements as the perspiration flows from the body. The king scatters abroad also the accumulations in the royal granaries. There will be no error.</string>
    <string name="h878877l6">Dispersing blood (i.e. fending off injury or violence), he keeps it at a distance — no blame!</string>
    <string name="h877788l1">One strongly desires long continuance. Even with firm correctness there will be evil. To take advantage of the situation, do not impose a direction on events. (Commentary: The misfortune arises from wanting too much immediately at the outset.)</string>
    <string name="h877788l2">All regret vanishes.</string>
    <string name="h877788l3">One is not consistent in virtue (actualizing-tao), and meets with disgrace. Trial: abashment.</string>
    <string name="h877788l4">No game in the field. (Commentary: When one is absent from one\'s place, how can one capture game? (Further notes: Perseverance alone does not assure success. No amount of stalking will lead to game in a field that has none.))</string>
    <string name="h877788l5">Giving duration to one\'s character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man. [There must be a time and situation for submission and a time and situation for decision and action. Do not persist too long in one mode when the other is called for.]</string>
    <string name="h877788l6">Constancy of excitement is bad. (Continuous agitation means misfortune.)</string>
    <string name="h777787l1">If one does not associate with what is harmful, there is no fault at all. So then even in difficulty there is no fault.</string>
    <string name="h777787l2">The great chariot used to carry. Having a goal or purpose to move towards, there is no fault.</string>
    <string name="h777787l3">A prince [inexperienced person capable of greatness maybe] makes use of experience to grow and strives toward a better adherence to the way (lit. heavenly sonhood). The small [inferior?] person is incapable of this.</string>
